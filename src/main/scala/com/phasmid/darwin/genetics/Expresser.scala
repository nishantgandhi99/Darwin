/**
  * Created by scalaprof on 5/7/16.
  *
  * The trait Expresser defines the mechanism for expressing a Gene (given its Characteristic) into a Trait.
  * There are two more or less independent phases, and one phase which combines the two others:
  * <ol>
  * <li>selectAllele: select which allele is expressed by the gene; The default implementation of selectAllele
  * assumes that the gene is Mendelian in nature and tries to determine its dominant allele.</li>
  * <li>traitMapper: create a trait from the given characteristic and allele.</li>
  * <li>apply: selectAllele and traitMapper.</li>
  * </ol>
  * All three methods may be overridden in extenders of Expresser, but traitMapper MUST be defined.
  *
  * //@tparam P the ploidy type
  * //@tparam G the gene type
  * //@tparam T the trait type
