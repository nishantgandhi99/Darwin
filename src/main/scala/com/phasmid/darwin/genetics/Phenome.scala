/**
  * This class represents a Phenome: that's to say the template for creating a Phenotype as a result of "expressing" a Genotype.
  * Phenome is to Genome as Phenotype is to Genotype.
  * Furthermore, Expresser is to Phenome as Transcriber is to Genome;
  * and characteristics is to Phenome as karyotype is to Genome;
  * and Trait is to Phenome as Gene is to Genome.
  * And, finally, Phenome is to Phenomic as Genome is to Genomic.
  *
  * Created by scalaprof on 5/5/16.
  *
  * @param name            the identifier of this Phenome, for example Homo Sapiens, or more generally, say, Apes.
  * @param characteristics the "characteristics" modeled by this Phenome: properties that are represented in a specific Phenotype
  *                        as Traits.
  * @param expresser       the Expresser function which maps Genes into Traits.
  * @tparam P the ploidy type for the Genotype, typically (for eukaryotic genetics) Boolean (ploidy=2)
  * @tparam G the underlying Gene value type, typically String
  * @tparam T the underlying type of Phenotype and its Traits, typically (for natural genetic algorithms) Double
