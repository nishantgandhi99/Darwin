/**
  * Class to define the concept of Fitness. Fitness applies in each of the two aspects of evolution:
  * Survival of the Fittest and Sexual Selection.
  *
  * Note that we do not make it a case class because we want to distinguish between creating new
  * instances of Fitness with/without checking the requirement.
  *
  * In Survival, fitness is a measure of the viability of an organism's phenotype adapting to an environment.
  * It's a Double value and should be in the range 0..1
  *
  * If a Fitness value is f, then the likelihood of an organism surviving one generation is f,
  * assuming that there are no other applicable fitness values other than 1.
  *
  * Thus, for an environment with many applicable fitness values, the overall likelihood of surviving one generation
  * is P(f1, f2, ..., fN) where P stands for the product.
  *
  * NOTE: this behavior is encoded in the & operator.
  *
  * In Sexual Selection, fitness is a measure of the probability of a mate being chosen from amongst other potential mates.

  * Viability represents overall fitness when there are many individual fitness values for an Adaptatype.
  * As discussed above, the basic model is that combined fitness is the product of each individual fitness.
  * Thus viability is could be defined simply as the product of each fitness.
  * Yet, this may result in some very small fitness values when an Adaptatype has many adaptations.
  * Thus it is generally better to use the geometric mean, by taking the nth-root of the product.
  *
  * Viability can also be used in the case where there is more than one sexually-selective trait. However,
  * in most simple systems, we typically stick to one such trait and thus Viability in that context will be
  * based on one Fitness only. You can think of it then as the Viability of a pair as mates capable of producing live offspring.
  * The probability of their progeny surviving is covered by environmental (survival) Fitness.
  *
  * CONSIDER We could allow some variation on this theme by using implicits.
  * However, in this particular situation, it's quite tricky because the Fitness and Viability both extend no-param
  * functions which yield a result. The use of apply makes it very difficult to implement an implicit mechanism.
